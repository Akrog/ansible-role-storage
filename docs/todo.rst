Future work
===========

The project being at the early development stages means that the current
features serve mostly to demonstrate the power behind a common storage
abstraction, but are somewhat limited.

There is work being done to add new features, and the next planned features
are:

- Volume cloning.
- Snapshot management.
- Extend volume.
- Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS).
- Manila provider for Shared filesystem.
- S3 provider for object storage.
- GCS provider for object storage.
